3decision creates 2 Amazon Elastic Load Balancers. Both listen by default on port 80. 

- lb-3dec-node : this application load balancer serves the 3decision user UI. In order to add SLL, one solution is to create a new HTTPS listener on port 443 and add your certificate. In parallel you can will need to create a CNAME DNS entry in your DNS provider, pointing to the lb-3dec-node DNS name.

- lb-3dec-etl : this application load balancer serves the 3decision etl UI. This UI will only be used by admninistrators to add users or debug.
