This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who want to deploy 3decision in an AWS subscription.
This Quick Start is an alternative to 3decision SaaS version for organizations that want to keep their data in their AWS scope.

3decision for AWS does not have the full flavor of 3decision vanilla SaaS version: 
It comes with a few link:#_product_description[Restrictions and Limitations], although they will disapear in the following weeks with the release of the next major version.

Other limitations exist and concern support, monitoring and maintenance:

- infrastructure monitoring is not included in this Quick Start.

- maintenance: 3decision updates are provided as helm charts updates. Although these upgrades are provided freely, the customer will need to apply helm upgrades himself to the EKS cluster.

- support: the Quick Start does not include a log collection mecanism. Support Requests to Discngine might require the customer to collect logs himself.
